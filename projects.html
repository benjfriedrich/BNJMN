<h2>⇢ <a href="http://52failures.com">52 Failures: A new failure every week</a></h2>

<p>52 Failures is a poetry project dedicated to creative risk. Here's what I say in the about page: <i>"In 2019 I’m going to be publishing one poem—good, bad, or blush-worthy—every week for a year."</i></p>

<h2>⇢ <a href="http://thechessfoundry.com">Chess Foundery</a></h2>

<p>Chess Foundry is a hobby of mine designing digital chess sets and other chess related projects. You may ask, <i>“Do we need more digital chess sets?”</i> The answer is, <i>“I suppose not really, but I don’t care.”</i> Chess Foundry is about making digital chess sets that look good and are natural to use.</p>
