I love this song, but the logistics of making this video are even more amazing. They fit at least 50 people into this tiny apartment to record it. Since they can't all see Gabriel as he conducts, it appears that they have sub-conductors who stand in door ways and at corners trying to exactly mimic Gabriel, so everyone stays in sync. This seems ridiculous, but somehow it appears to work.
