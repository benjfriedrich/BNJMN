I'm not a typically a big fan of stand-up comedy, with the exception of Stewart Lee, who I adore.  Hard to describe his approach, except to say that he is very clever, and excellent at using the audience itself as a source of comedy in a meta-comic way. 

This particular YouTube version is a bit hacky, but if you can ignore the weird image quality, it's very good.
