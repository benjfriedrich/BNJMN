I was reading The Spinner's Wikipedia and found this uncited line about how Motown Records used them during a lull toward the beginning of their career:

>With limited commercial success, Motown assigned the Spinners as road managers, chaperones, and chauffeurs for other groups, and even as shipping clerks.

I don't know if this is true, but if it is, it definitely paints a picture of the difficulties black artists of the era must have faced. I don't don't know if this is something that was common practice, but I wouldn't be shocked if it was.
