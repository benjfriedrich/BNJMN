Last night I dropped my little camera (the Fuji XF10) in a bucket of water while doing chores. It was off and I grabbed it immediately, pulled the battery within probably 3 seconds, and dried it as well as possible...right now it's under a heat lamp in between cloth bags filled with rice. Hopefully it'll still work, but I hate the tension of having to wait to know.
