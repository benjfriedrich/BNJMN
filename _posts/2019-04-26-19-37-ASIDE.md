I keep forgetting to link to my 52 Failures poems here. Truth be told, I'm very ambivalent about the project so far. 

I like the stuff I've made, but I don't really like the idea of being this 'poetry guy' who is posting his poems all the time. I guess part of the whole project was to become more comfortable being uncomfortable, so I have only myself to blame.
