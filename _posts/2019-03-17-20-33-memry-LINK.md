This song is so good. Perfect barstool songâ€”nostalgic and makes you want to belt along. 

I hadn't heard of this band, Mischief Brew, until now, but they're this anarco-punk band that is folk-y but with an edge. In 2016, the frontman of the group, Erik Petersen, who seems like he was a truly excellent person, took his own life, so they are tragically no longer active, which makes the song even more bittersweet.
