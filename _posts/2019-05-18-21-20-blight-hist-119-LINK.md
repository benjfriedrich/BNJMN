This Open Yale Course, HIST 119, by David Blight about the Civil War is fantastic. I've listened to the [podcast version](https://overcast.fm/+J2ShRF5dc) about three times. Blight has the best teaching voice I've ever heard—it's more like he's reading a story than giving a lecture. He doesn't fetishize the war in any way, but makes it relevant and interesting.

The Civil War is one of the historical events that really matters in American history. Highly recommend this if you're interested. 

(note: currently the intro lecture in the podcast version is missing, so you'll have to listen to that on the actual site. I do recommend you listen to it, even if the syllabus stuff is tiresome.)
