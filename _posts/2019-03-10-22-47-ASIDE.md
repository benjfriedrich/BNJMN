The thing I like least about illustration and graphic design work as opposed to coding, is that when I have an illustration project hanging over my head, it creates more anxiety than coding projects seem to. For some reason the coding stuff seems more like a puzzle that I will inevitably solve, whereas illustration feels more like I'm psyching myself up for doing a stunt that I'm afraid could end in disaster. 

The irony is I'm much better at design and illustration than coding. Just different mindsets.
