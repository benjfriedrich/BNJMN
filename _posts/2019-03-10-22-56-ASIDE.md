Today I was admiring the Herschel Supply Co computer bag I used in college. By now the Herschel Supply Co is a super hipster-y brand and it's everywhere, but at the time the company was really young, and I'd never seen one before I ordered mine. I remember one of my favorite teachers being impressed by it. 

My bag was a special edition color (it's tan and red) and it's a type of bag that they stopped making shortly after I bought mine. I poked around on the internet and couldn't even find it anywhere online and I forget the name of the model. 

To be honest, it's not an amazing bag—the compartments are severely limited—but I liked it a lot. I still use it as an overnight bag every once in a while, but I don't ever use it for my computer anymore.
