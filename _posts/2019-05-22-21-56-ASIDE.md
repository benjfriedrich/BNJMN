Using the X-T1 with my old lenses has been a ton of fun so far. It's really natural to get a subdued film look that doesn't seem gimmicky (at least to my eye). I was shooting mostly landscapes today, which was interesting, because that's not really the strength of vintage lenses (they aren't super sharp). Still getting used to the setup, but so far I'm pleased.
