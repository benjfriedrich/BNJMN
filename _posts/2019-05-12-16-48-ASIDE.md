Made some updates to my posting workflow. I was experimenting with having my photo posts auto-syndicated to twitter, but wasn't really happy with that. Now I have it so my photo upload shortcut gives me the choice to tweet the photo, and put in custom text, to make the tweet feel more native. 

I also implemented a drafts shortcut to dual-post an aside as a tweet if I want to. I should probably do the same thing for link posts...
