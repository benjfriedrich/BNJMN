We put Dewey down today after a long slow decline in health. He was a Welsh Corgi and was about to turn 16 in May. It was past time, but still very sad. His mother was my dog, Taff, and his father was my brother's dog, Govan. 

He lived all of is life, from birth to his final days, at the same home. He slept under the steps in the summer and in the porch in the winter. He loved food more than any other dog I've ever met. When he was a pup, we fed him separate from the other puppies, because he would eat all of the food before the others got any at all.

He's buried in the windbreak, alongside his mother and father. 

He was a good dog. Rest in peace, buddy.
