One of the gentlest, most beautiful songs I know.

There is one very simple lyric that I love in particular, and I think about all the time. It just goes, *"White cliffs and starfish â€” the tide like ruined lace."* In the context of the song it's calming and transportive. 

Exceptionally graceful writing by Gabriel Kahane.
