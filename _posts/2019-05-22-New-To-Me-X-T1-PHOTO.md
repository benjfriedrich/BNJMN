Just picked up a used Fujifilm X-T1 to use with my collection of vintage lenses. Basically it’s a top-of-the-line camera from 5 years ago. It’s a bit bigger than the Olympus EM10 I’ve been using and doesn’t have IBS, but it has a bigger sensor, better controls, and the image quality should be a great upgrade.
