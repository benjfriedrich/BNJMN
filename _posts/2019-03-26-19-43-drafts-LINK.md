If you are a nerd and work with text, Drafts is this great iOS app that allows you to a) write drafts (obviously), and then b) automate what you want to do with that text. The content on this site is mostly written in Drafts and published via custom actions I've written for it. 

Well now, after long last, there is a Mac version of Drafts. I've been running the beta for months. At this point it doesn't have automation features, but it syncs with iOS, so it's a great start!
