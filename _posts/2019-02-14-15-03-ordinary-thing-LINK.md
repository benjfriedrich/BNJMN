Week 7 of 52 Failures. I'm definitely running thin at the momentâ€”I didn't get started on this until a few hours before publication. On some level I wish I had more energy for it, but part of the point of 52 Failures is to publish whether I feel like it or not. 

It's not my favorite poem, but it's not bad either and I'm glad I pulled it off.
