This morning's episode of the Daily has the most heartbreaking, frustrating interview with an Iowan Trump supporter. He's loyal, but if you listen to his opinions, he actually disagrees with Trump pretty thoroughly. I know people like this guy.  There so many good and  admirable qualities that come though, even in this interview, but there is some kind of ideological capture going on. People have put their trust in the wrong places.
