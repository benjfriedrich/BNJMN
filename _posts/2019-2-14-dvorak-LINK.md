In the summer of 1893, the composer Anton Dvorak spent about three months in Spillville, IA—a tiny town about 30 miles from my home town—and it had always been a great disappointment to me that he wrote his most influential piece, Symphony #9 'From the New World', just before then in early 1893.

I just recently discovered that while the piece was probably *mostly* completed in early 1893, but it wasn't premiered until December 1893, which means that there is a good chance he worked on and *maybe* even finished the symphony in northeast Iowa. I don't know if that's true, but at least one source said so, I *really* want it to be true.
