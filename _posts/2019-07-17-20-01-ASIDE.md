Stewart Lee on UKIP
https://youtu.be/6KVO378tjsw

I was just thinking of this recently, and funny enough my brother actually brought it up too. A very politically relevant bit about immigration by the very funny Stewart Lee. I've probably said this before, but he might be the only stand-up comedian I consistently like.
