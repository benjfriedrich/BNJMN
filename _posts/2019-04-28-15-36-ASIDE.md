I learned today that Backbone State Park is the oldest official park in Iowa. Founded in 1919.

I'm curious as to why 1919, because that's well after the dawn of Naturalism in the US (as led by people like Teddy Roosevelt) and prior to the 30's, when the WPA really kicked America's Parks up a notch. 

My guess is that it's tied to the rise of Naturalismâ€”it just took awhile for it to work its way into Iowa.
