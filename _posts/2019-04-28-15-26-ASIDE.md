I'm having such a fun time with this new camera! I still haven't figured out how I want to balance out publishing photos. Right now I have a ton that I want to push, but I don't want to swamp the feed. On the other hand, I don't want them to get stale. 

In the long-term, I want the feed to be roughly chronological and reflective of my existence over time, so I can read back into it like a type of journal.
