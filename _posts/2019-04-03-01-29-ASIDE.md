Success! The previous post was uploaded via Working Copy using a shortcut I made with the Shortcuts app on iOS. 

Long story short, Shortcuts is powerful, but 
extremely clunky to work with. Very cool that it exists though. I prefer Drafts, but Drafts doesn't work with images. The star, however, remains Working Copy, which is a fantastic git client and enables automation.
