A melancholy, funny, beautifully shot spy show with wonderful music. One of those shows I keep coming back to. The main character wears a green, worn-out wool sweater that I am incredibly jealous of. 

The first episode is amazing, so if you don't like the show after the first episode, it's probably not for you. It's a bit off-beat, so you have to be on board. 
 
The show is on Amazon Prime.
