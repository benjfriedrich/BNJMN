I'm in research mode this evening. I'm trying to figure out different approaches for content management. 

I'm not really happy with the CMS's I've used...I was looking at Ghost, which seems very cool, but ultimately I'm not sure how it fits into what I'm interested in. I'm in a gray area with this little e-commerce project that I'm focused onâ€”my current solution is a bit hacky (I'm using forestry.io), but there aren't that many better options that I'm turning up.
