I'm not a huge baseball fan, in the sense that I don't follow it closely, but I do love ball games. It's the perfect sport for an outing, because it's not just about the game. It's a pastoral sport that doesn't demand your constant attention, so you're free to wander the concourse with a beer and a camera for a few innings, and still fully enjoy the game. The Twins lost today, but it was a very nice evening.
