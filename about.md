I'm Benjamin. Hi there!

Time was, everyone had a web log, and I guess this is a version of that. This website is my main landing pageâ€”the central repository for my online life.

This isn't here for pageveiws. It's just a way to mark my passing through the digital ether.

This is an about page, so I should tell you who I am: I am just a guy. I have some skill as a graphic designer and a web designer. I know how to do a lot of things passably well. I am from Iowa.

**Here are some ways you can reach me:**
