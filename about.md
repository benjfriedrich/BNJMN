I'm Benjamin. This is my spot.

Time was, everyone had a personal web log, and I guess this is a version of that. This website is my main landing pageâ€”the central repository for my online life.

It's a way to mark my passing through the digital ether.

This is an about page, so I should relate to you who I am: I am just a guy. I have some skill as a graphic designer and a web designer. I know how to do a lot of things passably well.

I am from Iowa.
