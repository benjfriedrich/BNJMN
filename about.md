I'm Benjamin. This is my spot.

This website is my main landing page—the central repository for my online life. Time was, everyone had a personal blog, and I guess this is a version of that. More properly, it's a web log. It's not a diary. It's a log—a reference. It's a way to mark my passing through the digital ether.

This is an about page, so I should relate to you who I am: I am just a guy. I come from a line of farmers, most of whom emigrated to the United States in the late 1800s from various germanic regions. I have some skill as a graphic designer and a web designer. I am a dilettante—a collector of skills. I know how to do a lot of things passably well.

I am from Iowa.

Here are some ways you can reach me, or follow my work. My other web projects can be found on the projects page.
